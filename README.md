# Container-Security

"Container Security: Fundamental Technology Concepts that Protect Containerized Applications" is a practical guide for developers, operators, and security professionals to assess security risks and verify the most effective protective measures. Many organizations are now using containers and orchestrations to run applications in cloud-native environments for scalability and fault tolerance, but how can you be sure your deployments are secure? This book is designed to answer that question.

The book delves into foundational technologies that support the "application containers" that run our daily business applications. It helps readers identify where systems can be attacked by looking at system components and possible attack patterns, thereby improving system security. For example, Chapter 10 discusses how to let containers communicate and explores how to improve security through their connections. Chapter 11 explains the basics of permission management.

Overall, this book aims to provide readers with a fresh perspective on how to protect their containerized applications and give them more confidence when using this revolutionary IT technology. The purpose of this project is to translate the original text into Chinese, making it easier for everyone to learn and use.
